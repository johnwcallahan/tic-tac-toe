# tic-tac-toe

Play tic-tac-toe against an unbeatable AI. 

This was created as a project for FreeCodeCamp, fulfilling the following user stories: 

1. I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
2. My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
3. I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

I decided to make the AI unbeatable as a challenge for myself, using a [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to recursively find the best move in any given position.
