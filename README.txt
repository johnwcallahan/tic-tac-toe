Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game created as a FreeCodeCamp project. 


The project included the following user stories: 
1. I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
2. My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again. 
3. I can choose whether I want to play as X or O. 


I chose to make the AI unbeatable by implementing a minimax algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).
